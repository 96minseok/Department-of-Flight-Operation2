<strong><u>2. Commercial Pilot License.</u></strong>
<ol>
  <li>A commercial pilot may be compensated for flying.</li>
  <li>Training for the certificate focuses on a better understanding of aircraft systems and a higher standard of airmanship.</li>
</ol><br>

  The Commercial Pilot Certificate itself does not allow a pilot to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and commercial pilots without an instrument rating are restricted to daytime flight within 50 NM when flying for hire.
  A commercial airplane pilot must be able to operate a complex airplane, as a specific number of hours of complex (or turbine-powered) aircraft time are among the prerequisites, and at least a portion of the practical examination is performed in a complex aircraft. A complex aircraft must have retractable landing gear, movable flaps, and a controllable-pitch propeller. See 14 CFR part 61, section 61.31(e) for additional information.
